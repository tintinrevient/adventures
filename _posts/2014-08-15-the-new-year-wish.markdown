The most treasured thing ultimately comes out to be the leisure time, to some extent, which would also lead to feeling bored. With it, (1) I can think; (2) I can make the right judgement; (3) I will not lose the intuition. In this way, perhaps work could be said to be the best disguise, for solitude and for being stupid. Prayer: more sleep.
