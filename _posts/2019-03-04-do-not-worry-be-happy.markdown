I pine for a life where my child can 读万卷书 行万里路.

For this year, I plan to find an apartment in Netherlands with a good neighbourhood and get to find a good primary school, in which she can visit in winter holidays.<br />
For this year, I plan to play with her more, read more books with her, start to learn Pinyin and writing, do the skating and swimming and get enrolled in some painting class from September (maybe next year is Piano).<br />
For this year, I plan to do more theories and projects, start to do some creative freelancing and keep painting and writing, find a job near home with work life balance.

In a nutshell, this year I need to grow together with my child more care-freeish and start to use time more efficiently for myself. keep the 5AM rule and more exercises!
