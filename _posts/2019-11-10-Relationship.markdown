**Relationship** takes root, pullulates, blossoms out, either bifurcates or results.

The convergence and divergence of love is too complicated for me to hack, and I'm scared of its fragility. It took such a long time for me to walk out of the vibes of hurting others and being hurt, so I now tell double-edged lies to avoid trouble, such as I'm married.
