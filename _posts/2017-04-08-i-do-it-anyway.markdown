I am not in the mood to cook today. It takes much time, and I could  **do something productive** instead. 

*But I do it anyway.*

I am not in the mood to study Danish today. I could **spend the entire tomorrow to do all** the assignments at once. 

*But I do it anyway.*

I am not in the mood for reading a book. **The internet is more fun**. 

*But I do it anyway.*

I am not in the mood for going to swim this morning. I could just stay in my warm bed for 2 more hours, so I could be more energetic throughout the day. **It's a great investment**.

*But I do it anyway.*

I am not in the mood for small-talking. **I don't know anything about this person**, and who cares about the weather anyway?

*But I do it anyway.*

I am not in the mood to initiate a conversation. Often times it is not appreciated, people are sometimes mean, and **I could look stupid**. 

*But hell, I do it anyway.*

I do it anyway, because I want to live by design and not by default. These decisions have been already made by me. Here and now it is not about evaluation, but action. 

Prioritizing is dangerous justification. It may camouflage real drives, reasons and excuses with ease, but always remember: fear, comfort, laziness; they are all the enemies of change. The one being unable to change ages rapidly, and soon will rot.

I am not in the mood for writing this post...
