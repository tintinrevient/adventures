Finally climbed out of the dark hole, again...

Kinda tired of caring for other people, because when facing the once-half-a-year nervous breakdown, I can't even help myself, at least to prevent myself from looking straight into that dark hole. Pain is so intense that the status of loneliness is felt vividly, and the loneliness is confined by the boundary of my body and mind, it just can't escape.

Can't shake off the feeling that I'm a burden, and where can I get consolation? Can only Keep looking for it and hope for the best.

A mark for the future me facing the breakdown, remember it will end and be hopeful in yourself.
