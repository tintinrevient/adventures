[KEA Project](https://github.com/gaboratorium/keaproject) is a shared repository where among with some of my classmates we have shared our notes from the first semester at Copenhagen School of Design & Technology's Web Development BA. 

We had three courses in this semester: Web development, Development environments and Databases, where we have worked with the following languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, C#, SQL.

Our notes include exercises from classes as well as module documents, slides from classes, course descriptions and mandatory hand-in assignments.

A repository for the second semester has been also created and maintained, called [Keaproject2]({{site.url}}/projects/keaproject2).
