It might be in a high percentage that we do so-and-so simply out of fear, or rephrase that, we are prone to being held hostage by fear. And fear leads to self-fulfilling prophecy.  What a perfect plan~（比如，[镜花缘](http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%95%9C%E8%8A%B1%E7%BC%98){:target="_blank"}里的伯虑国，还有，“The vicious cycle starts: if you fail at something, you think it is your fault ... you believe you can't so you don't even try.”）
