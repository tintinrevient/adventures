**Non-Linear of Web**
* It doesn't create **time** and **space**, what it creates are only fractions?
* It is result-oriented, and time serves as a factor measuring efficiency.

**Linear of Literature, Music and Film**
* It creates **time** and **space**, in which I can immerse myself and find consolation.
* It isn't result-oriented, and the lapse of time is enjoyable.
