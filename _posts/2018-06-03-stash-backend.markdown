**Stash Backend is my Bachelor project made for Copenhagen School of Design & Technology's Web Development BA programme.**

The project is a Backend-as-a-Service application which provides a REST API to interact with. The app requires Java 8 and Postgres to be installed.

The initial idea was to write a thin layer which we can use in our front-end and mobile applications to easily create and access records within a database. This idea however has grown into a BaaS, through which I had the chance to introduce how we can write a RESTful API in Java.

With Stash Backend we can easily integrate user authentication into our client application (including registration and login), record and query JSON documents from the database and upload files. For further information please have a look at the documentation on GitHub.
