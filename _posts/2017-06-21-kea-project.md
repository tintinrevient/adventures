**The name KEA Project refers to two repositories created by my classmates and me throughout the Web Development BA programme at Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. They contain notes taken from classes, slideshows about the curriculum, hand-ins and assignments.**

## First semester

[KEA Project](https://github.com/gaboratorium/keaproject) is the repository created for the first semester. We had three courses in this semester: 

- Web development
- Development environments
- Databases

Throughout the courses we have worked with the following languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, C#, SQL. Our notes include exercises from classes as well as module documents, slides from classes, course descriptions and mandatory hand-in assignments.

## Second semester

[KEA Project 2](https://github.com/gaboratorium/keaproject2) is a repository created for the second semester's courses. We had the following courses in this semester:

- Interface design
- Android development
- iOS development
- Project management
- Web security

Our notes include exercises from classes as well as module documents, slides from classes, course descriptions and mandatory hand-in assignments.

## Third semester

In the third semester of the programme we had to work on our Bachelor project. My project was called [Stash Backend]({{ site.baseurl }}/stash-backend) and you can find its source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/gaboratorium/stash).
