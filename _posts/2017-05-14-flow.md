Write Danish essay. Now cook lunch and dinner. Now write the Web Security essay. Now plan your summer holiday. Now finish the Android assignment. Now do your weekly accounting. Now go running. Now write a blog post about your thoughts.

What a Sunday. And I haven't even done anything before noon.

Virtuality creates loneliness. Work creates solitude. Solitude creates reality.
