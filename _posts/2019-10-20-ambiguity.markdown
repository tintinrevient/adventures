Ambiguity is the core. 

People are both kind and evil.

Things are changing. On the bright side, bad things don't last, but also good things.

Computation which base itself on disambiguity is now trying its best, but in vain.

Another thought is on the statistics, statistics cannot predict the extinction of dinosaurs, so statistics is in nature narrow-minded and biased.
