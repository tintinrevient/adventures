**Ambiguity** is the core. 
* People are both kind and evil.
* Things are changing. On the bright side, bad things don't last, but also good things.

Computation which bases itself on disambiguity is now trying its best, but in vain.

**Statistics** cannot predict the extinction of dinosaurs, and statistics is in nature narrow-minded and biased.
* **Cause** and **Effect** is artefact, which is only illusion created by people.  

**Robot** in essence feels no pain, and that is the divergence which renders it useless as a companion.
