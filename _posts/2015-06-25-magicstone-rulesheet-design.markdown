I've always been a fan of board games and digital board games. At the time I was also playing Hearthstone quite often, as well as Magic: The Gathering. However I was not fond of Magic's mana system, as I found it to bee too random and therefore frustrating. So I got some inspiration from Hearthstone and I came up with a new mana system for Magic. To make it feel official and easy to refer, I've decided to design a rulesheet for it. I called the format (very creatively) "Magicstone".
