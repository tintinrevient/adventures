**Octodo is an Android application I've written for the Mobile Development course at Copenhagen School of Design and Technology.**

 The application is a simple to-do application, in which we can organize our todoes into 3 lists: All, Important and Someday.

It features some of the classic Android UI elements: tabs, lists, a floating action button and a snackbar. The app is available on Google Play and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gaboratorium/octodo).
