**Technology** is now:
* Arrogant - There is always a technical cure for everything.
* Innovations are only **削足适履** - People cut their feet shorter to fit in the technical new shoes.

There are far more important things to devote your effort to:
* Suffering of boredom vs Suffering of wars or other human-inflicted pains
