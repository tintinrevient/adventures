**Technology** is now:
* **Arrogant**, as there is always a **technical cure** for everything.
* Innovations are only **削足适履**, as people cut their feet shorter to fit in the **technical new shoes**.
* AI is a mere mind projection of humans onto the machines.

There are far more important things to devote your effort to:
* Suffering of boredom vs Suffering of wars or other human-inflicted pains.
