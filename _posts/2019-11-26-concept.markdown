**Concept**
* Fame is a concept
* Attention from others is a concept
* Virtual reality is a concept

Concept is merely **a mind projection of self onto otheres and the world**, which is disguised under the cloak of **abstraction**?

Concept leads to **fragments** and thus **fractures**, which create **conflicts of self and others**?
