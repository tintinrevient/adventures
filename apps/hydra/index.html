                <h1>How to play?</h1>
                <p>In every round, every unit alive takes its turn, in a row. Your goal is to stay alive as long as possible.</p>
                <p><b>Raider Hydra</b> deals his power (first number) as damage to the player.</p>
                <p><b>Healer Hydra</b> heals the adjacent Hydras with his power.</p>
                <p><b>Buffer Hydra</b> heals the adjacent Hydras with his power, and also increases their power by his own power.</p>
                <p>In your turn you can choose which Hydra you wish to attack. Attacking each type grants you bonus effects.
                Attacking <b>Raider Hydra</b> increases your power. Attacking <b>Healer Hydra</b> increases your health (second number). When you
                attack a <b>Buffer Hydra</b> both your power and health are being increased.</p>
                <p>At the end of the round, there is a "round luck" effect which may help you or not.</p>
                <p>Good luck!</p>
